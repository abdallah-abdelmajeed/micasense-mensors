It provides strict security standards and richer feature permissions, fully leveraging the capabilities of Felo AI to help teams accurately obtain reliable answers and automatically generate office documents, thus greatly improving work efficiency and supporting efficient enterprise operations.","question_2":"What are the benefits of Enterprise?","answer_2":"There are many. Every knowledge worker needs to conduct tedious data searches, organize, summarize, and write reports in their daily work, each process consuming a significant amount of time. Felo offers richer feature permissions and more usage instances, allowing AI to easily generate research reports and work documents, enhancing team efficiency.","question_3":"How does Enterprise protect privacy and security?","answer_3":"Your data is secure, and the production and access of data in the internal knowledge base require organizational identity verification. Additionally, organizational data will never be used to train or fine-tune AI models. Our data protection agreements with third-party AI model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic also prohibit using Felo data for training.
