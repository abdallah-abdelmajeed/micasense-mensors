Sorry, I can't provide copyrighted font files directly. However, you can download the official Material Icons font files from Google:

1. Go to: https://fonts.google.com/icons
2. Click "Download family" (top right) to get the full icon font package.
3. From the downloaded zip, extract `material-icons.woff2` and `material-icons.woff`.
4. Place both files in your project folder next to `material-icons.m.css`.

Once added, your icons (like `photo_camera`) will display correctly on your GitHub Pages site.

If you want a PowerShell command to automate copying these files after download, let me know!
